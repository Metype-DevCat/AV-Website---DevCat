  <h4>
    Here at Adamsville High School, our A/V class works on many projects to help our students learn more about technology. We work with our students with different types of projects to expand their knowledge on audio and visual technology. Many of our students have shown great improvement with technology and explored a new career opportunity. 
<br></br>
Our class works with cameras, microphones, speakers, and much more. The students are allowed to be creative and use the different technology we provide to create their own projects.
